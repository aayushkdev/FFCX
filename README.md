# FFCX - Interactive FFCS Timetable Planner for VIT Students

## Overview

FFCX is an interactive web application designed to help VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology) students create and manage their FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) timetables. This platform provides an intuitive interface for course selection, conflict detection, and timetable visualization based on actual VIT FFCS slot timings.

## What is FFCS?

The Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS) is VIT's unique academic structure that allows students to:
- Choose their own courses based on interest and career goals
- Select preferred faculty members and class timings
- Create flexible timetables with theory and lab components
- Progress at their own pace across different semesters

   http://localhost:5001
   ```

## How to Use

### Adding Courses

1. **Click the "+" button** next to "Enrolled Courses"
2. **Search for courses** by typing in the course name field (e.g., type "data" to see Data Structures, Data Mining, etc.)
3. **Select from dropdown** to auto-fill course code, type, and credits
4. **Enter slot information**:
   - Single slot: `A1`, `B2`, `L31`
   - Multiple slots: `A1+L5`, `B1+B2`, `C1+L15+L16`
5. **Add faculty name and venue**
6. **Click "Add Course"**

### Managing Your Schedule

- **View course details**: Click on any occupied time slot
- **Remove courses**: Click on a course slot and press "Remove Course" 
- **Check conflicts**: The system automatically prevents conflicting course additions
- **Track progress**: View total enrolled courses and credits in the course list

### Understanding the Display

- **Blue slots**: Theory classes
- **Green slots**: Lab sessions  
- **Compact timing**: Each row shows both theory time and lab time
- **Course info**: Slots display course name and venue for clarity
