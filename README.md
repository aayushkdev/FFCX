# FFCX - Collaborative FFCS Planner for VIT Students

## Overview

FFCX is a project designed to help VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology) students collaborate and create their FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) timetables together. This platform aims to streamline the course selection process and enable students to coordinate their schedules effectively.
